# Sample project for Mob Programming with the iOS engineers.

1. Creating a simple collection view that download photos from internet. 
This list will be UI heavy. It will have corner radius, shadows, images processing, no caching, etc. A horrible list.

2. We discuss how to optimize it as much as possible in term of FPS, memory, image processing, etc..

3. We see the progress of the performance by visualizing the Xcode Instruments.
